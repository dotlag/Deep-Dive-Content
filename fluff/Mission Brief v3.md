# Situation
An SSC research vessel has gone dark on [[8947 Noctuae II - 3]], after an uptick in pirate activity.  Their last communication was an encrypted data packet, including a snapshot of one of the research NHPs.  The vessel appears to have been overrun by pirates and commandeered, and its location is currently unknown.

# Mission
Find and retake the SSC research vessel, and preferably rescue the crew as well.  Apprehend the pirates who have taken over the facility, and provide security to the facility while an SSC security team transits to the facility.

# Tactical Assessment
~~The pirates that have been observed in-system are a fairly light outfit.~~ The **[[Red Flag Fleet]]** is a relatively light outfit that operates out of a base built into the seventh moon of 8947 Noctuae II.  They operate a pair of gunships and one light cruiser.[^1]

The cruiser *Zheng Yi Sao* can keep pace with *Lucid* for long enough to be a potential threat, but *Lucid* displaces nearly twice what they do.  *Lucid* believes that the **Red Flag Fleet** will avoid any hard engagements and instead choose to perform hit-and-runs with their gunships and leave the *Zheng Yi Sao* to respond to any attacks by *Lucid*.

We will be outnumbered in terms of both number of ships and manpower, so we are going to have to be fast about retaking the SSC vessel.  To counter this material and manpower advantage *Lucid* will be running hit-and-run attacks against the **Red Flag Fleet** with the objective of discouraging any hard commits by their cruiser, and we will deploy loitering orbital weapon platforms to provide overwatch and defense against the gunships.

The Red Flag Fleet operate a facility with the capability of drydocking their vessels for repair and refit, allowing them to absorb attritional actions better than we can in the long run, but we should be able to put at least one of them in drydock for long enough to complete our mission.

# Execution
*Lucid Nonsense* will ~~provide orbital sensors and overwatch~~ be engaging in extended hit-and-run operations against the **Red Flag Fleet** while the *Craven* will be deployed planetside.

Orbital overwatch will be a constellation of single-use loitering weapon platforms set up to strike the **Red Flag Fleet** gunships.[^2]

*[[Craven]]* will have a full complement of 10 lancers operating in fireteams run by company veterans but each containing several recruits, and will be finding and retaking the SSC vessel.  Our SSC rep assures us that the pirates wouldn't have taken the SSC vessel far, because it was studying some ruins that had been found, and those ruins are what the pirates are interested in.

[^1]: This intel packet seems suspiciously convenient, but it's better than what we had.  - SM

[^2]: I don't like having *Lucid* not hanging out overhead, but this feels like a better plan in hindsight. - MT
