#### SSC REAL-TIME SLICE REQUEST INCOMING

`Lucid, it's been a while, how are you doing?`

++ Oh, pretty well.  Just brought on some new lancers and we've been doing some training and teambuilding.  How're things with the main branch?

`Pretty busy.  Been handling a bunch of projects in the Arm.`

`We've got some interesting new tech that should be coming soon.`

++ Color me intrigued, *especially* since you're sending a real-time instance.

`We've got some work that your crew is pretty well kitted for.`

`It's an SAR mission in pirate-infested space, and there might be a sea monster or two.`

++ We're between contracts right now, send me the mission brief and I'll look into it.

`Done.`

++ Huh.  We'd be able to be there in about a month.  Do you have any assets that are closer?

`Our closest asset is engaged in operations that we can't afford to take our focus from.`

`The next closest asset that is equipped for this mission would be performing autopsies instead.`

++ What're we talking for pay?

`We're willing to pay your normal rates, along with a bonus for expediting this for us.`

++ Okay, and when we encounter the pirates and sea monsters?

`3x combat bonuses should you encounter any resistance on the way in.`

++ Well, this is definitely within our capabilities.  I'll talk to my crew, but I don't think I'll have any trouble socializing this mission brief.  I can get back to you within 24 hours.

`Sounds good, send your contract via this relay when you're ready, and I'll get it approved.`

++ Works for me.

++ It was nice to talk, I hope we'll be close enough to do it without having to merge back on the other end soon.

`I should be able to manage that after this mission.`

#### LINK CLOSED

+++ If they were any slimier, I'd think they were biological.

++ At least the pay is good.

+++ Not *that* good.

++ Good enough to be an excuse to use the sub.
